⌨️ Keyboard Event Logger (Learning Project)
📌 Overview

This project is a Keyboard Event Logger built using Python and Tkinter.
It is designed strictly for learning purposes to understand how keyboard events work at the system level.

The application logs key presses only when the user explicitly starts logging and displays them live inside the GUI.

⚠️ This project is NOT a hidden keylogger and does NOT run in the background.

🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was created to practice and understand:

Event-driven programming

System-level keyboard input handling

GUI development with Tkinter

Listener-based architecture

State management (start / stop control)

It is intended for educational use only.

✅ Features

Start and stop logging manually

Live display of pressed keys

Handles normal and special keys (Enter, Space, Shift, etc.)

Auto-scrolls when output overflows

Simple and clear user interface

Cross-platform support (Windows / Linux / macOS)

🧠 How It Works (High Level)

User clicks Start Logging

Keyboard listener begins capturing key press events

Pressed keys are displayed in the application window

User clicks Stop Logging to stop capturing

Application exits cleanly

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter (GUI)

pynput (Keyboard event listener)

📦 Requirements

Install the required dependency:

pip install pynput

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository

Install dependencies

Run the Python file:

python key_logger.py

⚠️ Ethical Notice

This project:

Does NOT log keystrokes secretly

Does NOT store data without user consent

Does NOT run in the background

Does NOT auto-start with the system

It is created only for learning and demonstration purposes.

Using keylogging software without consent is illegal and unethical.

📈 Skill Level

Intermediate Python Project

This project focuses on logic and system interaction rather than UI design.

🚀 Future Improvements (Optional)

Save logged keys to a file

Add timestamps

Convert to object-oriented design

Clipboard or mouse event integration
